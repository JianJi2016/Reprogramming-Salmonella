# Reprogramming-Salmonella

Reprogramming Salmonella is a tool designed for visualizing Salmonella metabolomics data and figures related to the resistance of Salmonella Derby to ceftriaxone. 
The metabolomics process and visualization were carried out through a series of R scripts, including 
MetaAna2023.R, 
data processing.R, 
PCA.R, 
OPLS-DA.R, 
Volcano.R, 
Biomarkers.R, 
Zscore.R, 
Boxplot.R, 
Heatmap.R, 
ROC.R, 
Cluster.R, 
Corrplot.R, 
Samplecor.R, 
Pathway.R, 

R plot.R was utilized for Figure 4A and Figure 7A, 7B, 7C.
